# ‚õÖ Simple Weather

Throwing up somd old Vue 3 tutorial projects I was following several months ago ‚Äî I'm purging my laptop üíª of old projects / files, but seeing as I have _slight_ digital hoarding tendencies (better safe than sorry) I'm pushing this up to Github.

Although I'm quite fond of this one, so I MIGHT just throw it onto a server and use it as a simple weather app. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
